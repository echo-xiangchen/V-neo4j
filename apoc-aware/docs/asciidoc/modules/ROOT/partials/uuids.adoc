This procedure is part of a set of procedures that handle automatic adding of UUID properties, via the UUID Handler Lifecycle.
The UUID handler is a transaction event handler that automatically adds the UUID property to a provided label and for the provided property name.

By default automatic adding of UUIDs is disabled.
We can enable it by setting the following property in `apoc.conf`:

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.uuid.enabled=true
