The examples in this section are based on an Elastic instance populated with the accounts.json sample dataset from the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-index.html[Getting Started with Elasticsearch^] guide.
You can find instructions for setting this up at https://github.com/neo4j-examples/elastic-example[github.com/neo4j-examples/elastic-example^].

We can create a document with a `name` property of `John Doe` in the `customers` index, by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.es.post("localhost","customers","_doc", null, {
  name: "John Doe"
});
----

.Results

| value
|  {result: "created", _shards: {total: 2, failed: 0, successful: 1}, _seq_no: 4, _index: "customers", _type: "_doc", _id: "Im4w_3UBi9jUSsIzV4Js", _version: 1, _primary_term: 1}
|===

Elastic will generate an `_id` value for us when we use `apoc.es.post`.
If we want to provide an id, or update an existing document, see xref::overview/apoc.es/apoc.es.put.adoc[].
