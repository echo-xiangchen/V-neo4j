| Type | Description
|String|a Cypher query
|Virtual Graph|a Virtual Graph returned by `apoc.graph.*`
|Map|a map with two field `nodes` (a list of nodes, *mandatory*), `relationships` (a list of relationships)
|===

If you have a quite complex Graph, and you want to analyze and get some info about
a specific sub-graph in it, you can leverage the `apoc.meta.graph.of` procedure.

So for the given Graph Model:

image::apoc.meta.graph.example.png[width=800]

You can leverage the `apoc.meta.graph.of` procedure in this way:

image::apoc.meta.graph.of.png[width=800]

That will extract the Meta Graph of the provided query, with some stats like the `count`
for each node involved into the query.

If you want more details you can also look at xref::overview/apoc.meta/apoc.meta.graph.adoc[`apoc.meta.graph` documentation]
