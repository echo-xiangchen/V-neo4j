The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Counter {value: 10000});
----

.The following decrements the `value` once a second until it gets to 0:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.countdown(
  "decrement",
  "MATCH (counter:Counter)
   SET counter.value = counter.value - 1
   RETURN counter.value as count",
  1);
