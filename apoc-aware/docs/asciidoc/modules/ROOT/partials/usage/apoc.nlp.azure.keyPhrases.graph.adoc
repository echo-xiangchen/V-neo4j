The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

[source,cypher]
----
include::example$nlp-graph.cypher[]
----

We can use this procedure to automatically create a key phrase graph.
One node with the `KeyPhrase` label will be created for each key phrase extracted.

By default, a virtual graph is returned, but the graph can be persisted by specifying the `write: true` configuration.

.The following returns a graph of key phrases for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.azure.keyPhrases.graph(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  url: $apiUrl,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "KEY_PHRASE",
  write: true
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.azure.keyPhrases.graph.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.azure.keyPhrases.graph.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.azure.keyPhrases.graph.svg[title="Pokemon key phrases graph"]

We can then write a query to return the key phrases that have been created.

.The following returns articles and their entities
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
RETURN a.uri AS article,
       [(a)-[:KEY_PHRASE]->(k:KeyPhrase) | k.text] AS keyPhrases;
----
