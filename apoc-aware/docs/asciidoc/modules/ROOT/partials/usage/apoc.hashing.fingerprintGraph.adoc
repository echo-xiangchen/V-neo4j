The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (joe:Person {name: "Joe"})
MERGE (ryan:Person {name: "Ryan"})
MERGE (ryan)-[:FOLLOWS {since: datetime("2020-11-04")}]->(joe);
----

This function computes a fingerprint of the whole graph using the MD5 checksum:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.hashing.fingerprintGraph() AS output;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| output
| "655408F901B554A8999AEF61EA6D5AE5"
|===

We can pass in a list of properties to exclude from the fingerprint, as shown in the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.hashing.fingerprintGraph(["since"]) AS output;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| output
| "0583812D25093B4CD03C96DF15215048"
