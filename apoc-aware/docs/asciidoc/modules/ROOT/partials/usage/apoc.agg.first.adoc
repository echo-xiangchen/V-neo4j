The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (Keanu:Person {name:'Keanu Reeves', born:1964})
CREATE (TomH:Person {name:'Tom Hanks', born:1956})

CREATE (TheMatrix:Movie {title:'The Matrix', released:1999, tagline:'Welcome to the Real World'})
CREATE (TheMatrixReloaded:Movie {title:'The Matrix Reloaded', released:2003, tagline:'Free your mind'})
CREATE (TheMatrixRevolutions:Movie {title:'The Matrix Revolutions', released:2003, tagline:'Everything that has a beginning has an end'})
CREATE (YouveGotMail:Movie {title:"You've Got Mail", released:1998, tagline:'At odds in life... in love on-line.'})
CREATE (SleeplessInSeattle:Movie {title:'Sleepless in Seattle', released:1993, tagline:'What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only someone for you?'})

CREATE (Keanu)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:['Neo']}]->(TheMatrix)
CREATE (Keanu)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:['Neo']}]->(TheMatrixReloaded)
CREATE (Keanu)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:['Neo']}]->(TheMatrixRevolutions)

CREATE (TomH)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:['Joe Fox']}]->(YouveGotMail)
CREATE (TomH)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:['Sam Baldwin']}]->(SleeplessInSeattle);

This function provides a more efficient way of getting the first value in a collection.
For example, to find the earliest movie that each person has acted in, we could write the following query:

.Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie)
WITH p, movie
ORDER BY p, movie.released
RETURN p.name AS person, collect(movie)[0] AS earliestMovie;
----

This query collects all of the movies into memory, before returning just the first one.
We can avoid this build up of in memory state by using the `apoc.agg.first` aggregation function, as shown below:

.apoc.agg.first
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie)
WITH p, movie
ORDER BY p, movie.released
RETURN p.name AS person, apoc.agg.first(movie) AS earliestMovie;
----
