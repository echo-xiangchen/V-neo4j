The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

[source,cypher]
----
include::example$nlp-graph.cypher[]
----

We can use this procedure to automatically create the entity graph.
As well as having the `Entity` label, each entity node will have another label based on the value of the `type` property.
By default a virtual graph is returned.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph.svg>>.

We can compute the entities for multiple nodes by passing a list of nodes to the procedure.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon and Nintendo Switch articles
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph.svg>>.

On this visualization we can also see the score for each entity node.
This score represents the level of confidence that the API has in its detection of the entity.
We can specify a minimum cut off value for the score using the `scoreCutoff` property.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities with a score >= 0.7 for the Pokemon and Nintendo Switch articles
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  scoreCutoff: 0.7,
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph-cutoff.svg>>.

If we're happy with this graph and would like to persist it in Neo4j, we can do this by specifying the `write: true` configuration.

.The following creates a `HAS_ENTITY` relationship from the article to each entity
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  scoreCutoff: 0.7,
  writeRelationshipType: "HAS_ENTITY",
  writeRelationshipProperty: "awsEntityScore",
  write: true
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can then write a query to return the entities that have been created.

.The following returns articles and their entities
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (article:Article)
RETURN article.uri AS article,
       [(article)-[r:HAS_ENTITY]->(e:Entity) | {text: e.text, score: r.awsEntityScore}] AS entities;
----
